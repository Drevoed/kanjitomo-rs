#kanjitomo-rs

## Introduction.

This is a library for identifying Japanese characters from images rewritten in Rust using the source code of original kanjitomo-ocr at https://github.com/sakarika/kanjitomo-ocr.

Permission to use original author algortihms was given to me by Sakari Kääriäinen (KanjiTomo developer) at 4th of May this year.

This library does not try to copyright infringe the original developer work and instead serves as the learning ground in rust, image processing and pattern recognition for me.


# Current library state: pre-alpha WIP.
